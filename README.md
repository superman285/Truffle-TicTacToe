### Project Brief

---

This Truffle Box is an intersting DApp! üòç It's a Tic-Tac-Toe Game.



The game is built with <font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">Truffle</font>,<font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">Vue</font>,<font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">Vue-Cli3</font>,<font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">Solidity</font>,<font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">Web3</font> and some <font color=dodgerblue style="font-weight:bold">UI library</font>.

It is deployed on Rinkeby TestNet.



The SmartContract's game logic is referring to the dapp course from the `udemy.com`.
